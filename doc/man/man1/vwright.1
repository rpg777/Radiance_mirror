.TH VWRIGHT 1 8/29/96 RADIANCE
.SH NAME
vwright - normalize a RADIANCE view, shift it to the right
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vwright
.B distance
.br
.B vwright
.B name
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Vwright
shifts a RADIANCE view from a picture or view file given on the standard input
the specified distance to the right, putting out a complete set of
view parameters in a single line on the standard output.
This utility is most often used to compute a right-eyed view from
a left-eye view for stereo imaging.
.PP
The
.I distance
given is in world coordinate units.
A negative value indicates a shift to the left rather than the
right.
.PP
The second form substitutes a name prefix in place of the shift
distance, and produces constant assignments on the standard output
suitable for passing directly to
.I rcalc(1).
For a given prefix
.I N,
the constant names are as follows:
.sp
.nf
Nt:	view type ('v'==1,'l'==2,'a'==3,'h'==4,'c'==5)
Npx:	view point x value
Npy:	view point y value
Npz:	view point z value
Ndx:	view direction x value (normalized)
Ndy:	view direction y value (normalized)
Ndz:	view direction z value (normalized)
Nux:	view up vector x value (normalized)
Nuy:	view up vector y value (normalized)
Nuz:	view up vector z value (normalized)
Nh:	view horizontal size
Nv:	view vertical size
Ns:	view shift
Nl:	view lift
No:	view fore clipping distance
Na:	view aft clipping distance
Nhx:	derived horizontal image vector x value (normalized)
Nhy:	derived horizontal image vector y value (normalized)
Nhz:	derived horizontal image vector z value (normalized)
Nhn:	derived horizontal image vector multiplier
Nvx:	derived vertical image vector x value (normalized)
Nvy:	derived vertical image vector y value (normalized)
Nvz:	derived vertical image vector z value (normalized)
Nvn:	derived vertical image vector multiplier

.SH EXAMPLES
To start
.I rpict(1)
on a view .06 meters left of the view in the file "right.vf":
.IP "" .2i
rpict `vwright -.06 < right.vf` scene.oct > right.pic &
.PP
To move the
.I rad(1)
view named "left" 2.5 inches to the right
and render from there:
.IP "" .2i
rad -v "right `rad -n -s -V -v left examp.rif | vwright 2.5`" examp.rif &
.PP
To pass a view to
.I rcalc
for conversion to some other view:
.IP "" .2i
rcalc -n -e `vwright orig < orig.vf` -f viewmod.cal -o view.fmt > new.vf
