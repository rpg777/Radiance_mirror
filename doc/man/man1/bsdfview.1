.SH NAME
bsdfview - view a BSDF representation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bsdfview

input ..
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Bsdfview
renders a BSDF description interactively.
This is a script that creates a rad input file (RIF) 
then calls
.I rad(1)
to make an octree via
.I bsdf2rad(1),
then views the scene interactively.
.PP
The input is either a single XML file, such as might be produced by
.I genBSDF(1),
.I bsdf2klems(1),
or
.I bsdf2ttree(1),
or up to four scattering interpolation representation (SIR) files, as
might be produced by
pabopto2bsdf(1).
.PP
A rad input file will be produced, whose name matches the root of
the first input file but with any leading path removed (i.e., in
the current directory).
This RIF may be reused for subsequent viewing and rendering via
.I rad
without incurring the cost of another call to
.I bsdf2rad.
.PP
The quality preference may be set via the
.I \-q
option.
The number of processors to use may be specified with the 
.I \-n
option.
.PP
The program creates a number of views accessible via the
.I rvu(1)
"L" command:
.TP 10n
.BR def
The default view, showing the back and front BRDFs.
.TP
.BR fr
A view of the front reflection hemisphere.
.TP
.BR br
A view of the back reflection hemisphere.
.TP
.BR ft
A fisheye view of the front transmission hemisphere (from underneath).
.TP
.BR bt
A fisheye view of the back transmission hemisphere.
.TP
.BR pr
A parallel view of both reflection hemispheres from directly overhead.
.TP
.BR pt
A parallel view of both transmission hemispheres from directly underneath.
.PP
Additionally, all the standard views that
.I rvu
defines will be available (e.g., "xZ", "zl", etc.).
