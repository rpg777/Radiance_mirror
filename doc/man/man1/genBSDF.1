.SH DESCRIPTION
.I GenBSDF
computes a bidirectional transmittance distribution function from
a Radiance or MGF scene description given on the input.
The program assumes the input is in Radiance format unless the
.I \+mgf
option is specified.
The output conforms to the LBNL Window 6 XML standard for BSDF data,
and will include an MGF representation of the input geometry if the
.I \+geom
option is given.
(This is currently the default, and may be switche off using
.I \-geom.)\0
.PP
The geometry must fit a rectangular profile, whose width is along the X-axis,
height is in the Y-axis, and depth is in the Z-axis.
The positive Z-axis points into the room, and the input geometry should
not extend into the room.
(I.e., it should not contain any positive Z values, since the putative 
emitting surface is assumed to lie at Z=0.)\0
The entire window system should be modeled, including sills and
edge geometry anticipated in the final installation, otherwise
accuracy will be impaired.
Similarly, materials in the description should be carefully measured.
.PP
Normally, the input geometry will be positioned according to its actual
bounding box, but this may be overridden with the
.I \-dim
option.
Use this in cases where the fenestration system is designed to fit a
smaller (or larger) opening or is offset somehow.
.PP
The variance in the results may be reduced by increasing the number of
samples per incident direction using the
.I \-c
option.
This value defaults to 1000 samples distributed over the incoming plane
for each of the 145 Klems hemisphere directions.
.PP
In some cases, the processing time may be reduced by the
.I \-n
option, which specifies the number of simultaneous
.I rtrace(1)
processes to run in
.I rtcontrib(1).
.SH EXAMPLE
To create a BSDF description including geometry from a set of venetian blinds:
.IP "" .2i
genblinds blind_white blind1 .07 3 1.5 30 40 | xform -rz -90 -rx 90 > blind1.rad
.br
genBSDF blind_white.mat glazing.rad blind1.rad > blind1.xml
.SH NOTES
Currently,
.I genBSDF
computes only the forward visible transmitted component,
though the XML specification provides for front and back
transmission and reflection as well.
