.SH DESCRIPTION
.I GenBSDF
computes a bidirectional scattering distribution function from
a Radiance or MGF scene description given on the input.
The program assumes the input is in Radiance format unless the
.I \+mgf
option is specified.
The output conforms to the LBNL Window 6 XML standard for BSDF data,
and will include an MGF representation of the input geometry if the
.I \+geom
option is given.
(This is the default, and may be switched off using
.I \-geom.)\0
.PP
Normally,
.I genBSDF
computes components needed by a backwards ray-tracing process,
.I \+backward.
If both forward and backward (front and back) distributions are needed, the
.I \+forward
option may be given.
To turn off backward components, use the
.I \-backward
option.
Computing both components takes about twice as long as one component.
.PP
The geometry must fit a rectangular profile, whose width is along the X-axis,
height is in the Y-axis, and depth is in the Z-axis.
The positive Z-axis points into the room, and the input geometry should
not extend into the room.
(I.e., it should not contain any positive Z values, since the putative 
emitting surface is assumed to lie at Z=0.)\0
The entire window system should be modeled, including sills and
edge geometry anticipated in the final installation, otherwise
accuracy will be impaired.
Similarly, materials in the description should be carefully measured.
.PP
Normally, the input geometry will be positioned according to its actual
bounding box, but this may be overridden with the
.I \-dim
option.
Use this in cases where the fenestration system is designed to fit a
smaller (or larger) opening or is offset somehow.
.PP
The variance in the results may be reduced by increasing the number of
samples per incident direction using the
.I \-c
option.
This value defaults to 1000 samples distributed over the incoming plane
for each of the 145 Klems hemisphere directions.
.PP
In some cases, the processing time may be reduced by the
.I \-n
option, which specifies the number of simultaneous
.I rtrace(1)
processes to run in
.I rtcontrib(1).
The
.I \-r
option may be used to specify a set of quoted arguments to be
included on the
.I rtcontrib
command line.
