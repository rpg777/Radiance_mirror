.TH GETINFO 1 1/15/99 RADIANCE
.SH NAME
getinfo - get header information from a RADIANCE file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B getinfo
[
.B -d
][
.B "file .."
]
.br
.B getinfo

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Getinfo
reads the header of each RADIANCE
.I file
and writes it to the standard output.
Octree and picture files are in a binary format, which makes
it difficult to determine their content.
Therefore, a few lines of text are placed at the beginning
of each file by the RADIANCE program that creates it.
The end of the header information and the start of the
data is indicated by an empty line.
The
.I \-d
option can be used to print the dimensions of an octree or
picture file instead.
For an octree,
.I "getinfo \-d"
prints the bounding cube (xmin ymin zmin size).
For a picture,
.I "getinfo \-d"
prints the y and x resolution (-Y yres +X xres).
If no
.I file
is given, the standard input is read.
.PP
The second form of getinfo with a hyphen simply removes the header
and copies the body of the file from the standard
input to the standard output.
.SH EXAMPLE
To print the header information from scene1.oct and scene2.pic:
.IP "" .2i
getinfo scene1.oct scene2.pic
