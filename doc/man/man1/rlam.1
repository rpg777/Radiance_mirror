.SH NAME
rlam - laminate lines (records) from multiple files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rlam
[
.B \-tS
]
input1 input2 ..
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Rlam
simply joins lines from multiple inputs, separating them with
the given separator string (TAB by default).
Different separators may be given for different files by specifying
additional
.I \-t
options in between each file name.
An input is either a stream or a command.
Commands are given in quotes, and begin with an exclamantion point ('!').
If the inputs do not have the same number of lines, then
shorter files will stop contributing to the output as they
run out.
.PP
A hyphen ('-') by itself can be used to indicate the standard
input.
.SH EXAMPLE
To join files output1 and output2, separated by a comma:
.IP "" .2i
rlam -t, output1 output2
.PP
To join a file with line numbers (starting at 0) and its reverse:
.IP "" .2i
cnt `wc -l < lam.c` | rlam - -t: lam.c -t\| '!tail -r lam.c'
