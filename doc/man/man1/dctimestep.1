.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dctimestep
has two invocation forms.
In the first form,
.I dctimestep
is given a daylight coefficient specification and an optional sky
vector or matrix, which may be read from the standard input if unspecified.
The daylight coefficients are multiplied against these sky values
and the results are written to the standard output.
This may be a list of color values or a combined Radiance image,
as explained below.
.PP
In the second form,
.I dctimestep
takes four input files, forming a matrix expression.
The first argument is the View matrix file that specifies how window output
directions are related to some set of measured values, such as an array of
illuminance points or images.
This matrix is usually computed by
.I rcontrib(1)
for a particular set of windows or skylight openings.
The second argument is the window transmission matrix, or BSDF, given as
a standard XML description.
The third argument is the Daylight matrix file that defines how sky patches
relate to input directions on the same opening.
This is usually computed using
.I genklemsamp(1)
with
.I rcontrib
in a separate run for each window or skylight orientation.
The final input is the sky contribution vector or matrix,
usually computed by
.I genskyvec(1),
which may be passed on the standard input.
This data must be in ASCII format, whereas the View and Daylight matrices
are more efficiently represented as binary float data if machine
byte-order is not an issue.
.PP
Sent to the standard output of
.I dctimestep
is either an ASCII color vector with as many RGB triplets
as there are rows in the View matrix, or a combined
.I Radiance
picture.
Which output is produced depends on the first argument.
A regular file name will be loaded and interpreted as a matrix to
generate a color results vector.
A file specification containing a '%d' format string will be
interpreted as a list of
.I Radiance
component pictures, which will be summed according to the computed
vector.
.PP
The
.I \-n
option may be used to compute multiple time steps in a
single invocation.
The sky input file must contain the number of
columns specified in each sky patch row, whether it is read
from the standard input or from an ASCII file.
The columns do not need to be given on the same
line, so long as the number of values totals 3*Nsteps*Npatches.
Input starts from the first patch at the first time step, then the
first patch at the second time step, and so on.
.PP
The
.I \-o
option may be used to specify a file or a set of output files
to use rather than the standard output.
If the given specification contains a '%d' format string, this
will be replaced by the time step index, starting from 1.
In this way, multiple output pictures may be produced,
or separate results vector (one per time step).
